-- 3a. You want to keep a description of each actor. 
-- You don't think you will be performing queries on a description,

-- 5a. You cannot locate the schema of the address table. Which query would you use to re-create it?
-- option:  
SHOW CREATE TABLE sakila.address; 
-- for the SQL statement that can be used to create a table.

-- for formatted output
-- What is a schema?
-- It's like a plan or a blueprint. 
-- A database schema is the collection of relation schemas for a whole database. 
-- A table is a structure with a bunch of rows (aka "tuples"), 
-- each of which has the attributes defined by the schema. 
-- Usually a schema is a collection of tables and a Database is a collection of schemas.
